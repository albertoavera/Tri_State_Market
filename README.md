# Tri_State_Market
A project I made pulling data from realtor.com. This was an analysis aimed at doing a side by side comparison of the real estate market in the tri-state areas.  Here using a very simple machine learning model we were able to make quality price calculations.  This was also my last project of my graduate study.
